# Cat Placeholder images
[Live Demo Here!](https://aishyuu.github.io/cat-placeholders/)

This project was mostly practice for learning how to use API's

It's a project that, given the height and width of the desired image, will load a cat picture that you can download from by right clicking on it.

The project uses the [Place Kitten API](https://placekitten.com/)
